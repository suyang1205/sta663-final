# Sta663 Final-Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering
For the final project, there is no makefile. 
**final_project.ipynb** is the notebook that contains all the write up and codes. It also contains command that can run the test code;
**Bayhiecluster.py** is the python script that contains the clustering function;
**test_Bayhieculster.py** is the python script that contains the test code. 

Just run the notebook and you'll see all the results.
If you want to run the test code separately, just run the command "py.test" in your shell.
